# Accenture North America Data Analytics & Visualization Job Simulation (Excel)

This repository showcases my work on the **Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation**. In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to clean, analyze, and visualize sales data for tas. The project demonstrates my ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and create clear, interactive reports using Excel's advanced features.

## Project Overview

In this job simulation, I:
- **Cleaned and transformed** the raw sales data using Excel.
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover key insights.
- Created **pivot tables** and **charts** to visualize 


## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, data cleaning, Sum If, charts, and data analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project represents reaction types,reactions and content. It includes data on customer ID,category,content type,reation type,reaction score.
